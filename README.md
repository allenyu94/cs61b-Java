                setups.

jumping_cube_project: Two-player game in which the goal is to fill the board with your color cube. Rules are as follows:
                      
                      There are two players, say Red and Blue, The players each move in turn, with Red going first. A move
                      consists of adding one spot on any square that does not have the opponent's color. A spot placed on a
                      square, colors that square with the player's color. After the player has moved, we repeat the following
                      process until no square is overfull or all squares are the same color. 
                      
                      1. Pick an overfull square
                      2. For each neighbor of the overfull square, move one spot out of the square and into the neighbor.
                      3. Give each of these neighboring squares the player's color (if they dont have it already).
                      
trip_project: Given a list of Locations and Distances and given start and destination, it would print out the directions like
              a GPS.
