I am having an error with my PageAssembler. Notably when I try to create a new page with the form feed "\f".
It prints out an extra line in the beginning of the new page when it shouldn't be.
To recreate this error, run the newpage.tx (which corresponds to the 02-pages.tx test in the autograder) file with my program.
